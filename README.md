### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/inboxpraveen/FIFA-Player-Recomendation.git
cd FIFA-Player-Recomendation

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Search Players

- Enter player name, position, rating range, or nationality
- Filter by multiple criteria simultaneously
- View player cards with key statistics

### 2. Get Recommendations

- Enter a player's name
- Get AI-powered similar player suggestions
- Filter by same position or age range
- See similarity percentage for each recommendation

### 3. Compare Players

- Enter 2-4 player names
- View side-by-side comparison
- Interactive radar charts showing attributes
- Compare stats across all major categories

### 4. Switch Gender

- Toggle between male and female players
- Models are optimized separately for best accuracy
- All features work seamlessly with both datasets

## 🧠 How It Works

The recommendation system uses **content-based filtering** with the following approach:

1. **Feature Extraction**: 34 player attributes (Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical, and their sub-attributes)
2. **Normalization**: Min-max normalization for fair comparison across attributes
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity on normalized feature vectors
4. **Precomputation**: Similarity matrix computed once during training for fast inference
5. **Filtering**: Optional position-based and age-based filtering

**Time Complexity**: O(1) for recommendations after precomputation  
**Space Complexity**: O(n²) for similarity matrix, where n is number of players

## 📊 Dataset Information

The project uses FC 25 (FIFA 25) player data:

- **Male Players**: ~16,000 players
- **Female Players**: ~1,500 players
- **Source**: EA Sports FC 25
- **Attributes**: 50+ attributes including ratings, positions, physical stats, and play styles

### Key Attributes

- **Main Stats**: Overall (OVR), PAC, SHO, PAS, DRI, DEF, PHY
- **Detailed Stats**: Acceleration, Sprint Speed, Finishing, Positioning, Vision, Ball Control, and 28 more
- **Info**: Name, Position, Age, Nation, League, Team, Height, Weight
- **Skills**: Weak Foot, Skill Moves, Preferred Foot, Play Style

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask 3.0 (Python web framework)
- **ML/AI**: scikit-learn (cosine similarity), NumPy, Pandas
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Charts**: Chart.js (radar charts)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6
- **Fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Glassmorphism**: Modern, translucent UI elements with backdrop blur
- **Light Theme**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Minimalist**: Focus on content, reduce visual noise
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Accessible**: High contrast, readable fonts, clear navigation

## 📈 Performance

- **Search**: < 100ms for 20K players
- **Recommendations**: < 50ms (precomputed similarity)
- **Comparison**: < 10ms per player
- **Model Loading**: ~2-3 seconds on startup
